# Pig-python-game
This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Pig Dice Game written in Python. The game supports 2 to 4 players and uses a random number generator to simulate a 6-sided dice roll.

**How to Play**
Each player takes turns rolling the dice.

On each roll:

If the player rolls a 1, their turn ends and they score zero points for that turn.

If the player rolls 2-6, they can choose to roll again or hold:

Rolling again risks losing points if they roll a 1.

Holding adds their current turn score to their total.

The first player to reach 50 points wins the game!

**Features**
Interactive input and turn-based gameplay

Score tracking for each player

Clear win condition

Input validation for number of players and roll decisions
